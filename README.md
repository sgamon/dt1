## Helpers for playing Death Test 1

The context is almost too long to tell - This is a web-based helper system for a 
solo paper-and-pencil FRPG. You may be familiar with it... or not.


I played the 
[original](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/17729/death-test) 
back in 1981. Great stuff! I was hooked!

However, this helper will be for the 
[new version](https://rpggeek.com/image/4378771/fantasy-trip-legacy-edition).


Development Plan:

* Generate enemies from the random tables.
* Paragraph number breadcrumbs.
* Room contents/status.
* Party stats/inventory.
* Dynamic map.
